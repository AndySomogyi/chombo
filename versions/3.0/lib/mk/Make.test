### This file should be 'include'd in the GNUmakefile for a Chombo test
### directory _after_ the 'ebase' and 'LibNames' variables are defined.

## Variables required:
##   ebase: names of files containing main programs to build (without extension)
##   CHOMBO_HOME: path to the "Chombo/lib" directory (absolute or relative from the 
##                current "test" subdir
##   LibNames: names of Chombo libraries needed by this program, in order 
##   of search. Note that there is no need to include BaseTools, because it 
##   is automatically appended to LibNames

include $(CHOMBO_HOME)/mk/Make.defs
