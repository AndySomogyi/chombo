This directory contains many convergence tests that were used in the development of this application.  They
include gobs of very ugly code used to debug very specific issues.    These directories are not for the faint
of heart.   If you wish to emulate more reasonable convergence tests, either look in the EBAMRINS or EBAMRPoisson
directories or look in EBAMRGodunov/convergence/amr.
