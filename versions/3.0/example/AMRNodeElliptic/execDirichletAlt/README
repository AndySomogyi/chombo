The main program in this directory solves laplacian(phi)=rhs on the
set of grids specified in the input, and then solves it again on the
same grids refined by 2.  Then it writes out norms of the difference
between the computed solution on the original grids and the projection
of the computed solution on the grids refined by 2.

Boundary conditions are homogeneous Dirichlet.

The solver uses AMRNodeSolverAlt, which solves one level at a time,
beginning with the coarsest, and then setting coarse/fine boundary
conditions for each successive finer level.

Output is written to the files:
- out2.hdf5 or out3.hdf5, containing phi and rhs on the original grids and
  also the difference between phi on these grids and the projection of phi
  on refined grids.
- out2fine.hdf5 or out3fine.hdf5, containing phi and rhs on the refined grids.

Example input file:  inputs.2level
This is the same as ../inputs/read1op4quad16 but with verbosity turned off.
