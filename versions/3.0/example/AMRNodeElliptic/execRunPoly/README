The main program in this directory solves laplacian(phi)=rhs on the
set of grids specified in the input, and then solves it again on the
same grids refined by 2.  Then it writes out norms of the difference
between the computed solution on the original grids and the projection
of the computed solution on the grids refined by 2.

Boundary conditions are inhomogeneous Dirichlet.

The solver is Chombo's usual AMRNodeSolver.

Output is written to the files:
- out2.hdf5 or out3.hdf5, containing, on the original grids:
  computed phi, rhs, exact phi, gradient of computed phi, exact gradient
  of exact phi, error in phi, difference between computed phi on these 
  grids and the projection of the computed phi on the refined grids,
  truncation error, magnitude of error in gradient.
- out2fine.hdf5 or out3fine.hdf5, containing, on the refined grids:
  computed phi, rhs, exact phi, gradient of computed phi, exact gradient
  of exact phi, error in phi, truncation error, and magnitude of error
  in gradient.

Example input file:  inputs.2level
This is the same as ../inputs/read1op4quad16 but with verbosity turned off.
