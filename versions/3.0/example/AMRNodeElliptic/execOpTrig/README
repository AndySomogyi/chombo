The main program in this directory computes the laplacian of a
trigonometric polynomial phi and then computes the laplacian of phi on
the same grids refined by 2.  The domain is periodic in the x direction.

Output is written to the files:
- opOut2.hdf5 or opOut3.hdf5, containing phi, the computed laplacian of phi,
  the exact laplacian of phi, the error in the computed laplacian, and
  the difference between the laplacian on these grids and the projection
  of the laplacian on refined grids.
- opOut2fine.hdf5 or opOut3fine.hdf5, containing phi on the refined grids,
  the computed and exact laplacians of phi on the refined grids, and
  the error in the computed laplacian on the refined grids.

Example input file:  inputs.2level
This is the same as ../inputs/read1op4quad32period0 but with verbosity
turned off.
